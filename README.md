CurrentShift-XML-Generator
==========================

Commerce I.T. commissioned a new print credit machine in 2005. The machine controller produces a binary current shift file that needs to be processed by another piece of proprietary software. However, this binary file is not in a reader-friendly format so CurrentShift XML Generator was created to convert this binary file into a more format-friendly XML file.
